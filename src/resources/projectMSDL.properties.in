### Application window settings

# If set to true, the application will start in fullscreen mode
window.fullscreen = false

# If set to true, the application windows will have no window decorations if the OS supports it.
# This will possibly make the window immovable.
window.borderless = false

# Set the monitor to initially display the window on.
# 0 will use system defaults for placement, 1 and above select a specific monitor.
# If the number is too large, that last available monitor is used.
window.monitor = 0

# Two fullscreen modes are supported:
# - windowed: Uses a borderless window, filling the current monitor.
#             Does not change the current resolution.
# - exclusive: Sets the resolution to window.fullscreen.width/height and runs in exclusive mode,
#              like a game.
window.fullscreen.exclusiveMode = false

# If any value is set to 0, the nearest available fullscreen resolution for the current window size is used.

# Wait for vertical sync interval before displaying the next frame.
# This will limit max FPS to the vertical sync frequency but prevents tearing.

### projectM settings

# value, e.g. 64x32. This does *NOT* affect the actual render/shader resolution!
projectM.meshX = 200
projectM.meshY = 125

# Transition time in seconds for soft cuts
projectM.transitionDuration = 3

# Hard cuts are immediate presets transitions on an intensive beat.

# a hard cut is performed. "hardCutDuration" should be set lower than "displayDuration" to have an effect.

# Controls aspect ration correction in presets. Not all presets use aspect ratio, so this setting  only has an effect
# on presets using the aspect ration actively.

### Logging settings

# For detailed information on how to configure logging, please refer to the POCO documentation:

### Logging configuration

# Verbose log format, includes process/thread ID, source etc.

# The "times" property can be either set to "local" (default) or "UTC".

# You can configure log levels, channels etc. for each message source (logger) individually.
# See https://docs.pocoproject.org/current/Poco.Util.LoggingConfigurator.html for details.
# Example:
#     logging.loggers.AudioCapture.level = debug
